Creates source object based on params. Sources are used to create payments for a variety of [payment methods](https://stripe.com/docs/sources)

_NOTE_: For sources that require redirecting your customer to authorize the payment, you need to specify a return URL when you create the source. This allows your customer to be redirected back to your app after they authorize the payment. For this return URL, you can either use a custom URL scheme or a universal link supported by your app.

##### iOS

For more information on registering and handling URLs in your app, refer to the Apple documentation:

* [Implementing Custom URL Schemes](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Inter-AppCommunication/Inter-AppCommunication.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH6-SW10)
* [Supporting Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html)

You also need to setup your `AppDelegate.m` app delegate to forward URLs to the Stripe SDK according to the [official iOS implementation](https://stripe.com/docs/mobile/ios/sources#redirecting-your-customer)

##### Android

You have to declare your return url in application's `build.gradle` file.
In order to do that, add the following code replacing `CUSTOM_SCHEME` with the your custom scheme inside `android.defaultConfig` block.

```groovy
android {
    // ...
    defaultConfig {
        // ...
        manifestPlaceholders = [
            tipsiStripeRedirectScheme: "CUSTOM_SCHEME"
        ]
    }
    // ...
}
```
> Example: if the return url used is `my_custom_scheme://callback`, replace `CUSTOM_SCHEME` with `my_custom_scheme`.

**NOTE**: the redirection will be automatically handled by tipsi-stripe **on its own activity**.
In case of your app makes use of its own custom URL scheme for other purpose rather than handling stripe payments, be sure that `CUSTOM_SCHEME` value is not exaclty the same that the one used in the rest of the app.

> In such case you might end up using `my_custom_scheme_tipsi://callback` as return URL and setting `CUSTOM_SCHEME` equals to `my_custom_scheme_tipsi`, following the previous example.

You also need to add into your application's manifest section with redirect activity:
```xml
<activity android:name=".RedirectUriReceiver">
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="${tipsiStripeRedirectScheme}" tools:replace="android:scheme" />
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```
Thouse explicit designation of RedirectUriReceiver need to override default `example` redirect scheme, that has been already defined into tipsi-stripe library.

Also you need to add:
```
xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
```
as an attribute into the root node of your manifest.

**NOTE**: This is **only** necessary if you are going to use Sources!
